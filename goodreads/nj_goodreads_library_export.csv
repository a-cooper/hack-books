It's deliberately a twist on the normal tale, and I was very excited for this going in. It was written well, from two separate perspectives, albeit with probably a little too much description of people's appearances for my liking. I loved the character of Eva, whose voice was unique and interesting - the scorned, lonely Witch Queen with complicated, swirling emotions and a distate for people being stupidly heroic. I didn't like the other main character, Lina, as much, but I could see that she was written well - the classic, annoyingly-brave main character who keeps the plot going. <br/><br/>I'm not going to lie, I wanted this book to be gayer than it was. I was enchanted by the idea of a sapphic version of this kind of fairytale, and the focus on the heterosexual relationship kind of detracted from its potential in my mind - but I can also see what Jasinska was trying to do. <br/><br/>Overall, the plot was well done, and the stakes were clear most of the time. There was something about Jasinska's writing style which made everything a bit of a blur, but it was very unique and I enjoyed reading her writing, even if sometimes I missed a crucial point and had to go back. The characters were well done, but I just wanted to hear more of Eva's story. <br/><br/>I commend this book for its fantastic concept and ideas - I didn't necessarily completely love the execution of those ideas, but I liked it nonetheless and I'm very excited to see more from this author.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I'm enjoying reading the Narnia books by audiobook with the BBC Full Cast Dramatization, but this one struck me as a bit weird? It's probably because the plot seems irrelevant to the main plot about Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter. I liked the characters, and they were relatively compelling (especially the horses!) but I didn't like how the story treated Aravis. I also felt simultaneously intrigued and slightly uncomfortable with how the story created parallels to Mohammed with Tisroc using the ""may he live forever"" suffix. It felt constantly like something biblical or religious was going on, but I don't know enough about biblical times to know what references were being made. I suspect that my BBC Audiobook version was deliberately edited to be more generic about these kinds of things.<br/><br/>The plot was quite generic, though still entertaining in the same way any classic fantasy  might be. I probably enjoyed grown-up Susan and Edmund the best out of all the characters. Overall, I wasn't impressed by this book necessarily, but I'm glad I've read it as part of my exploration of the world of Narnia.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's told entirely in emails, letters and other written forms of communication, between two girls whose dads have recently become a couple. Their feelings towards each other change over the course of the book, but they are complicated and real and I love it.<br/><br/>To Night Owl From Dogfish is about family - found family, new family, and blended family. It's about accepting people for who they are, at all ages. It's about genuinely-written twelve year olds and what it's like to be a kid in a world of adult problems. It's about love and divorce, and how families can change so quickly and children's worlds can be changed all so suddenly and all at once.<br/><br/>I loved the way the unique storytelling method added complexity to each character, and the way the most dramatic moments in the story were told in retrospect in a series of emails, but somehow it all made it so much more dramatic. This novel was never boring, even though substantial sections just involved the ordinary everyday conversation between two twelve-year-olds. So many parts were hilarious and witty, and I just loved reading it and delving into their world. All the while, you can see the Big Plot forming in the background, and you know it's going to be interesting.<br/><br/>It's a middle grade book, but also very well worth reading for people all of all ages!<br/><br/>Some of my favourite quotes include:<br/>""...families are made from people who want to be together more than they want to be apart.""<br/>""Someday EVEN THIS will be a good memory.""",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This was the kind of book I probably would have loved more if I was younger and also from a different demographic. I didn't realise this at first, but it started as a screenplay written by Mikki Daughtry, and was adapted into a novel by Rachael Lippincott. <br/><br/>All This Time is an adorable, fluffy romcom that believes in true love and is full of all of your favourite guilty-pleasure tropes, while simultaneously executing a classic ""unbelievable"" plot idea. It's going to sound similar to all of your favourite rom-com movies, but in a way that's okay - it's just different enough to keep you guessing, and keep you caring. <br/><br/>I started out the book extremely cynical of the main character, a quarterback in love with the cheerleader, who spends the first half of the book being obsessive and essentially moping around. But then in the second half, everything was turned on its head and the main character started growing up and learning what was important. There was strong character development, and yet my feminism senses remained a little uncomfortable with the way the character of Marley was portrayed. <br/><br/>This book surprised me, in a good way. It's a very good book - I just worry that I might have stopped reading early in the first half if I wasn't invested in reading it as a NetGalley book, and for me this is its main downfall. The characters, without the plot from the second half of the book, just weren't compelling enough to draw me in. Maybe I don't see enough of myself in them, because they're the ""popular kids"". It doesn't take away from the brilliantly executed plot, and the well-designed, subtle morals of the story, but the characters just didn't click with me. <br/><br/>Thankfully, I know they will definitely click with someone else. The authors have put a little gem out into the world which will resonate with many people.<br/><br/>Grateful to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for giving me an advanced reader's copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In the last two hundred years, Australia has suffered the largest and most rapid loss of languages known to history. Today, despite efforts of revitalisation, Australia's languages are some of the most endangered in the world.""<br/><br/>This book is framed as a dictionary of words from the language of the Wiradjuri people, recorded by Albert Gondiwindi in the years just prior to his passing. It is interspersed with a narrative about Albert's granddaughter, August Gondiwindi, who still grapples with the loss of her parents and her sister. Interestingly, it is supplemented by diary entries from the perspective of the German Reverend who helped run the original Aboriginal mission on the site where the Gondiwindis' house now stands - and where it is about to be demolished by a big mining company.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed listening to this book as an audiobook, partly because the narrator's voice was so calm and knowledgeable, and authentic. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much if I had just read it on paper (though by the same token, I felt compelled to get a copy of the eBook so that then I could look at all the Wiradjuri words in the dictionary and write them down). However, I also enjoyed this story much more than I would any ordinary ""Australian historical fiction"" (which I normally find boring and unnecessarily descriptive, with a tendency towards caricatures rather than characters).  To a large extent, I enjoyed this novel more because of the insight offered by the First Nations author into all of these well-worn plotlines. The dictionary framing was a work of genius, and the relationship between the multi-generational plotlines worked very well for this kind of universal story about finding home and finding justice.<br/><br/>Moreover, this book is important to read. It's important because it is a calm, measured, OwnVoices Aboriginal perspective on the over-criminalisation of First Nations people, the need for a treaty in Australia, the difficulties and politics of native title, the short-sightedness of political activists, and the connection with family, land and ancestors. Thank you to Tara June Winch for sharing this story, and for sharing this language. I will do all I can to remember and respect it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's about how a system ostensibly designed to protect can become corrupt. It's about a young person caught up in the lies of everyone around her, desperate to get out. <br/><br/>But for me, the problem was that I already knew exactly what the main character's revelations would be. I could predict what was going on with the plot, and who was taking advantage of whom. The big realisations at the end were far from groundbreaking, although various twists in the last 10% of the book made me want to pick up the sequel to find out what happens. <br/><br/>I also found it difficult to care about the main character, who seemed perpetually reckless and sure of herself, but always seemed to miraculously survive everything she was put through. I never felt like anything could break her down enough to stop her. Maybe it's because she began the book starting from nothing, or maybe because she seemed to accept the ""chosen one"" arc incredibly easily for someone who should already distrust the system.<br/><br/>Despite the brilliant ideas behind this book - words being the source of all magic, and also the source of the Plague - and the interesting plot arc it attempted, I wasn't convinced that Farrow's writing helped the story land in the way it could have. Mostly, I was disappointed to find that I was reading a predictable book full of cliches and deus ex machinas, and I didn't care about the character enough to invest in her future. Thanks to the last 10-20%, I'm still interested in the plot, but I hope that any sequels to this book will take this plot opportunity and flesh it out further in more interesting ways.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Miller writes with dizzyingly beautiful prose, pulling you in from the beginning with tales of Ancient Greek heroes - articulated like the book you're reading is from the legends themselves. It all feels extremely authentic. What's more, it's a heartwarming, tragic tale of queer love, told in a way that universally applies to anyone who has ever loved someone and missed them dearly.<br/><br/>It's a slow build, with just enough tension to keep you going through the beginning of the book, but also many scenes of just pure young passion - dreamy days out in the woods that you wish would go forever. It turns into politics, and it turns into war. It turns into prophecies, and gods, and epic battles, and tragedy. It turns the tide of the plot so slowly and so quickly all at once. It reminds you of the longest, most pointless wars, where nothing is achieved and the most important things fall by the wayside - shot down in a blaze of arrogant glory, men too proud to raise their shields to what they know is coming. <br/><br/>I also can't stress how much I love the characters in this book - each an independent character, a mythology of their own. Patroclus and Achilles get their story. Briseis gives us a beautiful arc for the plot to follow. By the end of the book, my eyes were glued to the page and all I could hear was the beating of my heart as I just. kept. reading.<br/><br/>Read this book - it's a modern classic for a reason.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It traces the story of Rin, a determined young woman willing to do anything to make a better life for herself. Kuang investigates Rin's character from all angles, pushing her to her limit in the way that characters should be pushed. The author throws curveballs at the plot frequently, intensely, but it's always well-executed and finely woven into the earlier parts of the novel. Even though it's a very long book, there's never a lull in the steady classic-fantasy build - from training, to war, to disaster. <br/><br/>I loved the morally-grey characters, the obsession with power and the frank, clever way the author approached fictional approximations of historical tragedies. I loved how real everything felt - how people changed sides, went crazy, lost everything, and perpetrated exceptional cruelties. This book is a very dark fantasy, and it's not your average epic - not only is it set in fictional Asia, it's fast-paced despite its length and subject matter. The main character is exceptionally brave, but very very flawed in more ways than you would ever expect of a fantasy female lead. She also doesn't immediately fall into a love triangle, or any relationship at all.<br/><br/>Thank you to my friends at the Life's Library Readathon for recommending this book to me! This is EXACTLY the kind of book I've been waiting for - the kind of book which is true to the fantasy tropes I love most but gives them some extremely clever, compelling twists in its execution. I would recommend it very highly to anyone who ever liked fantasy books - just be warned, it might knock your expectations out of the park and you might wind up with a new favourite...",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It tracks the story of Xochitl, a <i>cuentista</i> who has the power and duty to absorb anyone's story in a process akin to Catholic confession and ""give it back"" to Solis, the sun god. It's set in either a dystopian future or a sci fi world, in which everything was destroyed by the sun and the world is a desert. It's written as one big story told to the sun god. It deals with people's ""stories"" and how they are told and kept safe. It's full of well-used ""they/their"" pronouns, and it treats queer relationships as normal and doesn't even question their queerness. On top of all this, the story is told about half in Spanish (which I don't understand), but once you got over the initial hurdle of understanding, they were integrated extremely well into the story and added to the authenticity of the world it was based in. <br/><br/>The plot was a very slow build, and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't all-consuming. I knew that each time I picked up the book, every bit I read would have some kind of slow character development at the very least. Xochitl was a good character, but not overly compelling. What compelled me the most about her character was her relationship with Emilia, which I absolutely loved. I also didn't see the very final resolution coming, but I was very happy with the way the author resolved the plot relating to all the stories coming alive and haunting the characters in the desert.<br/><br/>This book is very dark at times, and not a light read at all, but it's a book about freedom, love, religion and stories. It's about finding yourself and coming to peace with who you are and what your journey has been up until now. It is about the journey, not the destination. Oshiro executes their vision of this book very well. It's not for everyone, but many of the aspects should be highly commended. I hope this book becomes a classic in its genre.<br/><br/>Thank you to NetGalley and Tor Teen for providing me with a free advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But when one day the lesbian baker goes missing, what will Sir Violet do? He reminds me of Bilbo Baggins - after all, he goes on the whole adventure of this novel and all he wanted was some cinnamon rolls...<br/><br/>I felt a lot like Sir Violet reading this book. I knew from its blurb that it would be cute and adorable and easy to read, and full of fun medieval shenanigans, but I didn't expect that it would be full of so much heart. <br/><br/>Consider the story of a fairytale dragon: he's usually the only one of his kind, living a lonely existence up in the mountains. Others are scared of him and don't know how to interact with him. <br/>The author makes the point that, in the real world, many LGBT+ people are treated like dragons and shunned from the village. But she makes it with nuance and vigour, centering queer voices in the story and giving them real depth. Characters pursue real friendships, navigate real (and complicated) relationships, and learn how to listen to each other's stories. And importantly, they don't just ride off into the sunset together at the end.<br/><br/>Here is one of my favourite quotes from the book:<br/>""It was odd, really. They had all these tales about rare creatures like dragons ... yet he'd never heard a single one about a girl whose identity did not match the way her body was perceived by others.""<br/><br/>Thank you to NetGalley and Atthis Arts for giving me an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!

This was a very high quality set of poems - I just didn't personally love it. It deals with many very important themes, and several of the poems hit the nail on the head with the way they describe their content. This is a book about sexual abuse, and survivors of this trauma. It is about how they go on.<br/><br/>The poems were well designed around common themes, and told the story of Anderson's life. They also told smaller stories, turning thoughts into poems that sat well together over the course of the book. They were so vivid that I almost felt compelled to hide them away. <br/><br/>The problem for me, I think, was that I struggled (as with Speak) to connect with the main character. It felt less like I was being invited into her world and more like I was being kept at arm's length. I understand why, but I would have preferred to be actively thrown into the character's entire world. Often, I felt like something was missing. Maybe that's just the detached nature of poetry, or the nature of the subject, but it caused me to disconnect from the writing. Maybe I just wasn't in the right headspace.<br/><br/>So I recommend reading this book of poetry slowly, and carefully. You never know when the next poem is going to hit you hard in the guts. I felt less like I was sharing something with the author and more like I was being told something, and occasionally it was something I didn't want to hear. Poetry should do this - poetry should challenge you, and hit you hard - but it's important to consider your limits when reading content like this. Check in with your head and your heart before you do.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

On that front, this book absolutely soared: I learnt about the intricacies of everything from navigating friendships to getting dressed, from being a queer YouTuber to being a kid just starting high school. I really appreciated seeing the world through Ciel's eyes, and from their perspective, with an honest style of narration.<br/><br/>However, there were a couple of major things that disappointed me about this book, and many of them may be personal. I felt jarred by the uncritical discussion of various teenage themes, and the way the author expected the reader to just accept that two characters this age were in committed, long-term relationships with boyfriends in early high school/ middle school. Although these characters were mainly developed in an age-appropriate way, this contributed to my unease. Yes, debateable things aren't meant to be critically analysed in middle-grade books, but should they be presented entirely uncritically? I'm concerned mostly because it might lead more conservative readers to think that, in turn, the narrator is just uncritically presenting other important viewpoints, when in fact Ciel makes various good arguments about the majority of the trans / gender-related issues.<br/><br/>I was also very underwhelmed by the lack of plot / plot resolution and the lack of substantial character development - very few of the things that happened caused any anguish in the protagonist, or for the protagonist to want something. I wanted to have a reason to be passionate about this character, but I struggled to find one. <br/><br/>All of these things might just be my personal inclination to have a strong plot / strong character development, rather than a slice of life, and my hesitation to invest in a story which (outside of the broad plot about Ciel being non-binary / trans) seemed to be more or less about social circles, boyfriends and complaining about a life which is ultimately pretty good. That being said, I think this book is VERY important for its incredible representation of trans issues and queer issues generally, and I commend the author for having the bravery to put this story out into the world. Thank you for sharing your experiences - even if I didn't connect with the characters, reading this book has taught me a lot.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Want a subtle, empathetic insight into what it's like to be queer in politics? Gotcha. Want interesting, vulnerable, multi-layered protagonists? Boom. Multi-layered like a giant royal wedding cake. Want hilarious quips and comments littered in amongst touching love letters? You got 'em.<br/><br/>I listened to this book as an audiobook and even though I know I would still have loved it as a paperback, the audiobook added something more. I started the book thinking Alex was a complete jackass, but learned to love him as the pages wore on - his actions spoke louder than words. I started the book thinking Henry would be a paper-thin Handsome Prince - but boy, was I wrong. This isn't just a romance (though it's a beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, gut-wrenching love story) - it's the story of two intricately developed characters with their own lives, their own family problems. Their stories are intertwined, and the impact they have on each other's worlds just keeps endlessly driving the plot along. It's exactly what a compelling story ought to be.<br/><br/>This book was very steamy, and almost in danger of becoming ""fan-fiction-y"" and superficial, but the author turned down the steam when appropriate and filled out all the important parts of the book with love and commitment - raising the stakes exponentially with family love, sibling love, platonic love, and romantic love. Oh, and did I mention there's a non-romance plot, a complicated POLITICS plot, going on in the background? It adds so much depth to Alex, Henry, and all the characters around them. What's more, everything doesn't just magically resolve itself. There's still a future for these characters beyond the pages of this book.<br/><br/>I would 100% recommend this book to anyone - particularly if you are looking for a really good queer romance. You go through an emotional rollercoaster, but you won't be disappointed by how it all ends. These queer characters get a book for themselves - a book that isn't just about their queerness, or even about their love. It's about them, as people, and that's what makes it so fantastic.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

However, I have read the original Austen and I was captivated by the idea of a modern muslim retelling of the classic tale - and I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>It took me a long time to get into this book, but by the time I hit three-quarters of the way through I was falling fast into the action. I really admired the world-building and the fact that the author unashamedly used muslim and South Asian terms and references without much explanation. It helped me feel like I was properly immersed in this world and this culture, and this was definitely my favourite part about the book. <br/><br/>Similarly, I admired the way that Jalaluddin characterised her ""Mr Darcy"" character, Khalid. She went out on a limb for many (if not most) Western readers by characterising him as very conservative and more or less an Islamic fundamentalist. She confronted Islamophobia head-on, particularly by contrasting the ""good"" and ""bad"" muslim stereotypes between Ayesha and Khalid. I think the fact that this is a Pride and Prejudice retelling is the most critical part of the point she makes. We were all okay with Mr Darcy being a sexist prick in Pride and Prejudice - why shouldn't we be okay with a similar conservative male figure in a conservative society being a similarly sexist prick in this book? It makes the reader confront any perceived biases against muslim people - particularly muslim men - and I think that this is really special.<br/><br/>This book was recommended to me by my friends at the Life's Library Readathon group, particularly SaraCat, and I am very grateful that they convinced me to read it. I don't love this kind of romance myself, and I don't love Pride and Prejudice, but I think that the exploration of biases in this book is absolutely top-notch. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if they are the kind of person who would call themselves a progressive - precisely because it made me think twice about my own hidden assumptions and misgivings.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I felt that it probably went on for a little bit too long than it needed to, and it was a little bit self-indulgent in the beginning, but once the book ramped up it got extremely interesting. <br/><br/>Unlike in AART, Hank used various POV characters to tell this book, which gave him a lot more room to manoeuvre, and made his characters significantly more likeable for me. They all still kind of sounded like Hank, but it was less blatantly annoying than when the only POV character was April. One or two of the POV characters really kept me reading, but I couldn't find it in myself to care as much about the others.<br/><br/>Hank's book is very quotable, very well-plotted, suprising and funny. I didn't love any of the characters, and I suspect that what I'll remember most is the plot. I appreciated the many sparks of brilliance in this book, and I really respected the execution of the project that was started in AART. Hank planned this duology very well, and he definitely got his point across. It was enjoyable to read, but I just didn't connect with the characters as much as I felt I could have.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

All of the characters were built with such complexity and the dialogue was full of so much subtle insight that I found it actively difficult to stop listening. I'd highly recommend the audiobook in itself - with a wonderful cast of voice actors - but the plot, the characters and the pacing kept me going.<br/><br/>Evelyn is the kind of character you want to love and hate at the same time. You think you know exactly what crazy Hollywood drama she's going to get involved in next, and you think maybe it'll be shallow or over-the-top, but what you really get is something more subtle. You learn about the intricacies of Hollywood, through the sexism and the racism and the discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. You learn to empathise with the struggle of a very famous and powerful woman to learn how to value her family and her love at the cost of everything else. You watch generations pass as Evelyn goes from a young Cuban upstart to a glamorous aging movie star. <br/><br/>This book is about family. It's about not being afraid to love who you were made to love. It deals with sexuality, with sex, with marriage, with love and with friendship - all as completely different, separate things. It keeps you guessing about Evelyn's many husbands, but it all comes together just right in the end. You feel like you've become intensely familiar with this one woman and her impact on the world, her life and her fame - and its impact on her. You know everything about her family, and everything about what matters to her. <br/><br/>You don't need to love Hollywood and celebrity to love this book - you just need to be fascinated by people. This book is by turns exhilirating and heartbreaking, with a romance that tears at your heart and a lifelong friendship which is just as powerful. This book and its characters will stay close to my heart for a long time yet, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

At the start, it was the great plot and the interesting main character and her quest to find the father who had abandoned her that grabbed me, and by the end I was fully invested in all the major characters and super excited to read the sequel. It left off on a small cliffhanger, but the reason I want to read the next book isn't about the cliffhanger - it's just about wanting to spend more time with this motley crew of characters.<br/><br/>Adrienne Young expresses the intricacies of this world so well, and uses it as a device to hold back character information in a way that serves both her plot needs and our enjoyment of the story itself. Every chapter ends in a little cliffhanger, keeping us going and keeping us hooked into the plot. Each chapter is short, and makes you want to gobble up just one more chapter of that beautiful story - just to find out what happens to your intrepid main character and cast. What's more, Young's prose is filled with vivid details, sprinkled through expertly without a trace of getting sidetracked from the action in each scene. It feels like you're looking at a scene from a painting which has come to life. It's this writing style which makes the seafaring setting really come to life. See below some quotes from Fable - examples of Young's beautiful writing. <br/><br/>Overall, I gave this book 4.5 stars because it was just a very good fantasy book at a very high standard. It didn't have anything particularly out-there, but it gets many points for just how compellingly it was written. There's an unexpected romance, structured to peak in an unconventional way, and tons of interesting dynamics between the main characters. I couldn't fault the writing, and the plot and characters were both very well done and executed. I've found myself thinking about these characters every day since I finished reading the book. I can't wait to read more!<br/><br/>I'm very grateful to both NetGalley and Wednesday Books / St Martin's Press for giving me a free copy of this eARC in exchange for an honest review.<br/><br/>Quotes:<br/>""But I wasn't the sweet little girl who'd once ridden through these streets perched on his shoulders.

It deals with the incredibly important but incredibly difficult subject of rape, and the consequences as they manifest themselves in the life of a young woman in high school. I am particularly impressed with how well the graphic novel captures the feelings and experiences of the main character through a combination of dialogue (by the author) and beautiful illustration (by the artist). Many pages just made me stop and take a deep breath, or made me want to barrel on and keep reading to learn more about the main character and her story. <br/><br/>I didn't personally invest much in the main character, but I admired the way it was written. The author made it clear from the beginning that the main character had depression, and followed a predictable but still interesting arc about how she would work towards a life free from the pain of this traumatic event. <br/><br/>It was an enjoyable, short read (I read it in one evening) but at the same time I learnt a lot.

I've been a long-time nerdfighter, and I ordered the signed copy of this book all the way over in Australia because I wanted to support Hank Green as a creator. First of all, the concept blew me away: using the idea of an alien invasion / First Contact situation to talk about YouTube fame and stardom? Genius. Honestly, genius. Nobody's ever thought of that before - at least, I've never even heard of a book like that. It was well written, with a plot that was only slightly predictable, and the (very spoilerific) ending blew me away because I was definitely not expecting that to happen. I'm hooked, and I want to read the next one. I have to know how this finishes. It has a very compelling plot, one which is well-developed.<br/><br/>I also really liked the insights into fame that are peppered throughout the book. It really did feel like a memoir, and many of the plot choices made April a compelling character. But it also made her extremely hateable. I know this is fine, and that it's okay to still like books where the main character really frustrates you, but there was one extra element that frustrated me: She sounded just like Hank. She didn't sound like April May. I love the vlogbrothers, and I'm interested in what Hank has to say, but I'm not sure that I want to hear it through a caricature. <br/><br/>What I'm saying is that my existing knowledge of Hank Green as a person probably made this book less enjoyable for me, because it seemed like April May was just a self-insert for Hank. Sure, I learnt a lot of things about fame, but I would have more happily read an autobiography. I think this book will be fantastic for anyone who has never heard of Hank Green The Internet Personality, but I had. It was still a good book in many other ways - from side characters to plot development - but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

They're quiet and reflective, and not overstated. They aren't too fancy, and they aren't too confusing. I ""got"" something out of almost every poem, and even when I didn't get it, there were very few poems where I didn't just enjoy Lewis's thoughtful, articulate collection of words into poetry.<br/><br/>This poetry collection, and discussing each poem with the Life's Library book club, inspired me to create my own poetry. It made me want to share each poem with everyone around me. It made me want to read the poems out loud just to hear what they sounded like. Lewis's work deals with themes from relationships and anxiety to our place in the universe. It's the kind of book you can pick up over and over again, and I know that I absolutely will.<br/><br/>The poems that really stuck with me included:<br/>- On The Train, A Man Snatches My Book<br/>- Saccadic Masking<br/>- When I Tell My Beloved I Miss The Sun<br/>- When They Find The Ark<br/>- My Dear Wolfish Dreamboat, Stand Still<br/>- On Distance<br/>- You Can Take Off Your Sweater, I've Made Today Warm<br/>- The River Reflects Nothing<br/>- Last Night I Dreamed I Made Myself<br/>- God's Secretary, Overworked<br/>- Magic Show<br/>- So You Want To Leave Purgatory<br/><br/>It's quite a lot!

Reading the audiobook back - the BBC Full Cast Dramatisation one - was fun, but I don't feel like I learnt anything new! The audioplay was really well done (more dialogue than anything else) but I found myself being more cynical this time about the built-in biblical references. It's a bit unsettling to think about how successful these narratives were when I was a kid, but I guess a lot of that comes from the fact that the story it's based on is one of the oldest, much loved stories of all time. It's very compelling. And CS Lewis weaves a believable, magical world for kids, despite my cynicism.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Each layer I peeled off the top gave me more insight into the mystery of what lay inside, but each layer was also beautiful in itself. <br/><br/>The book is about Vivek Oji, but it is also about the people around him, the people whose lives were intertwined with his. It tells a sensitive story that reads a little bit like an 1800s family drama, but seamlessly integrates elements of life in Nigeria. It sets up character perspectives that help you piece together the mystery but simultaneously make you want to know more about the character themselves.<br/><br/>One of the best ways I can describe this book is ""brave"". Akwaeke Emezi tackles difficult themes - themes of love, family, home, guilt, redemption, sex and what it means to be LGBTIQ+ in Nigeria. When you read the book, even if you think the plot is starting to look predictable, you may well be surprised about what you find. In the end, this book reminds the reader that sometimes being afraid, being too careful, or caring too much, might be what hurts you the most.<br/><br/>I was given an electronic advanced reader's copy of this book from NetGalley and Faber & Faber Ltd in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.<br/><br/>Here are some of my favourite (non-spoilery) quotes from the book:<br/>""That morning, she was wearing an orange cotton dress; she looked like a burning sunset, and Chika knew immediately that his story would end with her, that he would drown in her large liquid eyes and it would be the perfect way to go.""<br/>""If nobody sees you, are you still there?""<br/>""Chika stayed downstairs, fielding the visitors who pressed sympathy into his hands until his fingers felt dead.""",,,2,,,0,,,,,

The main character became a mother at 15 and is finishing her high school degree with dreams to become a chef but the reality of a two-year-old at her side. Acevedo's poetic prose (it's actually prose this time) tells the story of Emoni's senior year in little snippets and glimpses, a well-designed structure which adds spice to a largely linear plot. Thanks to Emoni's incredible cooking talents and Acevedo's wonderful writing, some chapters are full of descriptions which make your tummy rumble just reading them and other chapters are just straight-up recipes, adding an extra dimension to the book. I felt like I could just pick up Emoni's recipe and taste a part of the book itself.<br/><br/>Many side characters were interesting and well developed, especially her best friend Angelica and her grandmother 'Buela. This book was about family, and it was about motherhood, and it was about coping when the world throws everything at you in a blur. It felt like my own senior year with just the way it was told. There's so much going on in your final year of high school, and on top of all that you're just trying to work out what you want to do for the rest of your life. No big deal.<br/><br/>Emoni is a brilliant character because she's just like any other young woman finishing high school - she just has to deal with all the complications of having a child as well, and with knowing it'll be financially difficult (impossible, even) to follow her dream. This book is really well written and definitely worth reading - for the characters, for the representations, and for the themes they represent. There are lots of hard choices in this book, and Acevedo writes about them in a story simultaneously filled with all the light and fun of a classic YA novel. It really does feel like senior year all over again.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But when I realised that the nerdfighter Tamora Pierce book club was reading through the entire series, I jumped at the chance to join. I decided to read the audiobook, however, to switch it up a little bit.<br/><br/>I don't remember liking this book quite as much as the other ones in the Immortals quartet as a kid, probably because I never really enjoyed books that were heavily about animals / animal magic and this one was entirely about Daine discovering her powers and her pack. But I think as an adult I liked it a lot more because I could really appreciate (as a creative writing student now) how well-designed and fleshed out Tamora Pierce's world is. I also laughed out loud many times at this book, and thanks to the slow burn of an audiobook I think I remembered all the minor characters much better.<br/><br/>I didn't love the audiobook itself (probably because I already had voices for all these characters in my head) and I wouldn't read this book again for no specific reason, but I'm glad that I did. It's really nice to revisit a world and the characters you loved as a kid. You look at them differently now, and it's a nice exercise in self-reflection to think about why exactly that might be so.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's an #ownvoices book by a strong Black woman about the coming-of-age story of a young, rich, Black girl living in LA during the Rodney King riots. I knew nothing about the riots before starting this book, and I've come away from it wanting to learn so much more. <br/><br/>The main character, Ashley - her identity seemingly a contradiction in terms - was extremely well developed by the author. Although at the beginning of the book she and her friends seemed to be one-dimensional ""popular kids"", Reed didn't shy away from introducing complicated situations to develop Ashley's character. There was nothing predictable about the way she tackled the subject of high school friendships crumbling, or the way she painted a picture of a complicated, raw, family struggle to belong. Even the romance in the book wasn't immediately predictable, which is really saying something for YA books. Better yet, Ashley found herself in a lot of moral grey areas, some of which I'm not even sure were resolved by the end of the book. It makes Ashley real and three-dimensional, and I loved reading more about her story.<br/><br/>Outside of that, Ashley is accompanied by a whole cast of characters you love to root for, and whose plotline is well developed: Lana, who gave me some serious Perks of Being a Wallflower vibes; Jo, the sister and perfect foil to the main character's experiences of prejudice; and Lucia, whose story is still undiscovered. I also loved the development for both the mum and the dad that happened around mid-way through the book - parental development is also something rare in a YA book.<br/><br/>The setting was nostalgic, beautiful historical fiction in the 90s, and although I've never liked LA as a city I felt like I was transported back to my own senior year of high school. The author's writing style was filled with fluid flashbacks - sometimes scenes were so well-executed I had to stop and put down the book to process it all, or wipe away my tears. The whole second half of the book escalated so well that I couldn't stop reading.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this book is similar to The Hate U Give, but possibly even better. It deals with racial themes, and so much more. It deals with friendship, family, love, feminism, growing up and learning to live with not just injustice, but your reponse to it. And on top of that, it's incredibly well written. I would highly recommend this astonishing debut novel to anyone I know.<br/><br/>Here are a few of my favourite quotes from the book:<br/>""Sometimes when your grown-ups are sad, their sadness feels even heavier than your own.""<br/>""Don't you ever get tired of being a symbol? Don't you ever just want to be human?""<br/>""Maybe Jo and I are more alike than not, just broken in different places. I miss my sister in the present tense.""<br/>""Sometimes there is an us, sometimes there is a them, and sometimes it's okay to be a we.""<br/><br/>Thank you to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster Australia for the advanced reader's copy of the ebook, which I received in exchange for an honest review.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

We found Jeanne Willis's story about Eeyore being scared there was Another Donkey to be overall the best, with Kate Saunders' hilarious tale about a ravenous Pooh Bear looking for the ""Sauce"" of the river being easily the funniest. Each of the characters had brilliant little idiosyncracies, which made it easy enough to switch between voices, and the new stories stayed true to the original themes.<br/><br/>We remember first reading about Winnie the Pooh in little Golden Books - but over 15 years later, we're still getting the same kind of joy out of these stories, and I think that's something beautiful in itself.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Her prose is so beautiful at times it makes my heart happy just reading it. At other times, it feels like her glowing descriptions of clothing and the main character's own beauty are going a bit too far - but simultaneously, that kind of description (and character focus) is something that makes the book different. <br/><br/>Throne of Glass and its main character Celaena are interesting, positive takes on teenage femininity. It's very much what I would call a young women's fantasy. Despite a bunch of cliches - like a love triangle - and a similar plot to The Hunger Games, I really appreciated the way Maas developed her world, most of all. And I look forward to how she will develop her characters beyond the existing predictable plotline. The characters of Kaltain, Nox, and particular Nehemia - and their relationship with Celaena - were a breath of fresh air, and very enjoyable to read about.<br/><br/>Sarah J Maas sets up a very believeable magic system with a believable plot structure - part Hunger Games, part murder mystery, part romance - but most importantly everything came together well. I'm excited to read the next book, because despite all the cliches and tropes I really like this set of characters and I'm interested to see what happens to them next.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Unlike his other books, this one is action-adventure, and there's less straight-up fighting and killing because it's about problem solving, riddles and puzzles. Reilly's action scenes go at breakneck speed when you're reading it, despite his overuse of ellipses (...), exclamation marks (!) and italics. Everything's a little bit over the top, but that's okay when you're watching an action movie and you don't expect much more.<br/><br/>I realise that I learned to write like this, and it's been an interesting exploration of everything I've learnt since I first read Reilly's books at 13. Don't use too many adjectives or adverbs, don't use two words when one will do, and don't! use! too many! exclamation marks! Nonetheless, Reilly's book holds up to some extent - he has a firm grasp on world politics at the time, and interestingly uses the place of Australia for his main hero. He also pulls the interesting trick of making the main characters into a little family. Unfortunately his characters are all a bit two-dimensional, and the only one who leaped off the page for me was Lily - ironically, the person who was doing the least LEAPING in this book.<br/><br/>I'm glad I read this book, particularly to reflect on the way my writing style has grown. Reilly's action scenes are masterful, but his plot and his characters let him down. You've really got to suspend your disbelief for a lot of the ""history"" in use. It's a bit of a mixed bag, ultimately - but if you're looking to read the equivalent of a fast-paced action movie with bits of Indiana Jones, bits of National Treasure, and bits of The Da Vinci Code, this is it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It still wasn't my perfect cup of tea, with a storyline that sidelined all its women, and various confusing bits or bits that were actively unpleasant to read, so I've only given it 4 stars,  but there are three main reasons this book is worth reading:<br/>1. Somehow it is more relatable and uniquely Australian, more so than any other book I have read. It's set in Brisbane in the 80s, and there are things the characters do at school, or refer to around the city, which are uniquely things that only Brisbanites or Queenslanders generally would know. And somehow, Dalton manages to make it all sound exciting, and make it part of the story, especially with the characters' youth.<br/>2. Dalton has a wonderful writing style, which draws on some Aussie-isms but mostly is just very consistent. Dalton's voice seems weird at first in the head of a 12 year old boy, but as the character ages it all starts to gel very nicely. His detailed but fast writing style is differnet to anything I've read - and it's simultaneously thematic and important to the main character.<br/>3. The plotline and the characters are very well done (except for the female characters, as noted above). It deals with a realistic drug scene (I know, I work in a similar area), deals with themes of family, love, hope and how to get past a life of crime, and it manages to balance some ""weird"" magical realism with what would otherwise be harsh reality. <br/>It's like an Australian Neil Gaiman novel, whose story is uniquely told and comes together effectively. In the final part of the book, I just couldn't stop reading. In some ways, it was like watching a train crash, but in other ways it was like watching a flower bloom. I had complicated feelings about this book, but I think it was for the best that I did. I'm glad I read Boy Swallows Universe.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

As someone currently working as a paralegal in this area of law in Australia, about to finish my law degree and hoping to become an immigration lawyer, I'm simultaneously appalled and just kind of sad about the US experience of undocumented immigrants. This was a really genuine, unique, but hopeful insight into this situation that affects so many people in our world - it was a story of being torn apart and trying to put yourself back together. It was poetic, and it was done very well. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The world was so well developed, and the characters great - I just wanted to get back into it constantly. Everything was alive. It was a typical long winded fantasy/sci fi but its many positives made up for it. It gave an interesting comment on ecofascism, as well as incredible concluding observations on the importance of telling stories, the understanding of mortality, and the relevance of stories to history. The ending scene was pure gold. Not to mention the fact that it deals with older characters in a romance, and for a YA book does an impressive amount of considering intergenerational issues. The use of Stalkers as a plot device was unique and interesting, and although this book suffers from some cliches it is altogether one of the best series in this genre I have read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It was a love letter to black women, brown women, womxn in general, and a beautiful exploration of history all in one.

I've never read a book like this before and I don't know when I ever will again. I'm not one for re-reads, but getting back inside the heads of such well-developed characters, inside such a flowing, poetic prose style from Evaristo, would be nothing but wonderful. I'm sure there would be even more to pick up on a second read! I would 1000% recommend this book - I didn't think I was going to like it, and I was unsure how I'd get through it, but I am super glad I picked it up. Reading it was a breeze!

They've added interesting dimensions to every character, added new characters that come right off the page, and developed the plot to a place that's great in the lead up to the final book. It was a bit slow at first, but some of the best fantasy fiction is like that. The inter-generational character set is unique to these books, and they make you feel for their entire history. You're at knife's edge of tension for the entire end quarter of the book, and you don't know what the characters are going to do. Maybe Hester's not going to save the day any more - and then what? This book brings into question everything earlier in the series. As a sequel, particularly a penultimate sequel, it does its job extremely well. I am so excited for the next one!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Batwoman is compelling and her backstory is interesting, so I'm intrigued and want to learn more. The book is quite graphic in terms of violence/gore, and vaguely risque, so it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's very impressive and progressive for the first book about a lesbian superhero that I've read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's very well researched and makes a great point at the end of the story. My favourite part was the depiction of the story from both angles - the white settlers/convicts aren't necessarily painted purely as villains but given some sympathy. Possibly the sympathy is a little too strong, but Grenville makes it clear that the end situation is far from perfect and gives us an uneasy feeling about the mistreatment of indigenous people in Australia.
