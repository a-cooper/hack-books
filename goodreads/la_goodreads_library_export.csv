They lack any real depth or even arc and some of them read different than they should.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>The worldbuilding is superb, Hwae feels like a real place, with geography, history, customs, language...I felt like I really was there in the world.<br/><br/>There is also a mayor point regarding belonging, (provenance) and the choice to live our lives. A point is made that we get to choose how important things are to us whether they have inherent value or not, even if they are fake, what they represent can still be valuable and worth protecting. The same happens with personal history, while we all have a past, we get to choose our own way and make pur own family if we so choose. Which leads me into the bad.<br/><br/><br/>The bad:<br/>The main character is Ingred a human from Hwae, regular human, NOT Radchaii, in fact the difference is brought up several times but she still reads like a Radchaii character, with the same way of seeing the world and reacting to it, except she is obsessed with serbat and not tea, but thats the only difference. <br/><br/>I felt like the rest of the characters had an interesting premise but they were never explored or developed, including Ingred and it feels so wrong. The relationships between the characters also lack development and cohesiveness and the jump from enemies to friends, or from friends to frenemies to associates,  with barely any explanation as to how or why. This is particularly glaring as the plot feels like its angling towards the “found family” trope (a favourite of mine) but doesn’t deliver because the relationships are weak and don’t feel impactful.<br/><br/>The character structure also skips some time between chapters which feels like a way to glare over some plot (holes?) and simply avoid giving an explanation.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Reads like the diary of a flip floppy person who is trying to convince themselves and us that they are “doing the right thing” but never manages as they contradict themselves repeatedly on several instances.<br/><br/>The author stresses the importance of avoiding neglect and providing physical nurturing to children, so making the witholding of food a mayor problem only to say in the next chapter that it’s ok to let the child go hungry if they forget their lunch because it’s discipline.<br/><br/>The same goes for spanking. Huge importance is given to the fact that some ways of hitting are worse for the shame they create than for the actual pain occasioned but the author then goes on to say that light spanking (up to a certain age) and slapping children on the head are an ok way to discipline them. <br/><br/>Mostly nonsensical “spiritual but not religious” new age bs.<br/><br/>I give it 2 stars because at least it has taught me the value of consistency and the consequences of the lack thereof<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The adventures of a girl that finds a door to another world, and all the ensuing hijinks.<br/><br/>I like January, she is a fairly believable protagonist, which means she is not always heroic, or right, she just improvises her way through life.<br/>Her adventures are entertaining enough but I can’t help but feel as If I have read a book and its sequel all in one. Some might find the cyclic narrative amusing but I though it was uninspired. Can’t be mad about it anyway, page 33 warns us that “every story is a love story, if you catch it at the right moment” so its not surprising that we get not just one, but two love stories.<br/><br/>I guess this is what irks me a lot about this book, both love stories are about two random people who fall in love after not having spoken 5 sentences and the book just assumes this is enough motivation in which to hinge the plot and move the story forward. It isn’t.<br/><br/>On that same note, several characters repeatedly dismiss the love and bonds formed over 22 years of living together as a simple “get over it Jane” and this loss is only ever adressed at the very end of the book as a closing afterthought that feels utterly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>I guess self-improvement is not a straight road.<br/><br/>The book does a good job of depicting prejudice and racism and the barriers that those bring, as well as full on adressing white privilege, its add a level of grounding to a novel sometimes all to preoccupied with fantasy to be relatable any other way.<br/><br/>Look, its a quick simple read, not the greates book ever, far from the worst. Very basic plane jane fantasy book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It usually rides hand in hand with depression or anxiety or other mental disorders. I had no idea I suffered from this because I have lived like Walter Mitty for most of my life, I just though it was the normal thing, but it is a problem, what I liked about the book is that it writtes about his daydreams in a way that is enticing and not shaming as well as entertaining and almost heart warming.<br/> It is also super short, so if you dont like it in the end its not like you just lost hours of your life.<br/>I actually wish it had been longer",,,1,,,0,,,,,

If you are on that demographic you will resonate with it, I know I did. But make no mistake, this book is not one of senseless staring and oh that one stupid first love. This book is written with a perfectly sarcastic sense of humor, which I love, but at the same time keeps a really well defined characters interesting. Zoe is not simply a deify to the Obin, she is also a maybe-not-so-clueless teenager. I did not think a grown man could conjure up such a good and true perspective pf what it is to be a teenager. I was wrong. The book answers a couple of questions left unanswered in the last colony. This is not jus a borig retelling of the story. I think I actually enjoyed this more than the last colony.

I didnt find one. Not only this book is a copy cat of stephanies other books, meaning its all about a love triangle in which the characters have torturing sentimental relationships.<br/>The good side of things is that is considered scifi(theres a lot of fiction, of you count the aliens, but litle to none science, but hey) and that makes it more appealing to me.<br/>The book has some troubles with the pace with overdrawn scenes from time to time but it overall does a good job, i did find quite amusing the conversations between Wanda and Mel, Mel always having that sarcastical side that i love. I Dont quite get the motivations of the humans to keep fighting when its quite clear that the world is wayyyy better without us and the aliens are perfect in every sense of the world. Overall, my opinion of the movie lowered after reading the book, because it seems that all the blondes were portrayed with jet black hair in the film and the other way around, good thing stephanie was present at casting and filming, just in case the director thought of adapting it right.<br/>You can totally pass on this one.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
